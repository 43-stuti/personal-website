The Dancing drawing robot was created to let people feel more comfortable about their bodies and their movements-about being weird sometimes.
Some people love expressing while dancing; some do it while drawing. We thought, why don't we combine those two and crate something fun.

Tools and Technologies 

The robot
- Our robot was driven by the arduino microcontroller, connected to DC and servo motors. 
The robot moves from left to right using the DC motors and has arms that rotate 180 using the servo motor.

The Poses 
- We picked out famouse dance moves and trained a model on ml5 to recognise the poses. 
These poses were meant to act as a replacement for the standard front, back etc buttons on controllers used for robots.

Connecting the robot and the poses.
- We created a webpage that had a "menu" of poses available to the user. This webpage initiated an instance of our ml5 model to recognise the poses captured by the webcam.
- This webpage was connected to a websocket server(built on NODEJS). 
- The server on receiving the data forwards the data to our arduino through serial communication.
